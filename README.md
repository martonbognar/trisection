# What is this?

This small project was originally created for a maths lesson to demonstrate trisectioning an angle using only compass-and-straightedge constructions.
You can read more about the problem at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection).
The original code was written by Nohcra and myself.

# Installation

1. Install a Pascal compiler (for example [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org/)).
2. Compile `trisect.pas`
3. Run the created .exe file
